# Vision Statement
  The ListAssist product helps people organize and keep track of many types of lists. Some find it 
tedious to create multiple copies of a list for multiple people- ListAssist allows people to share any list 
with anyone. People who want to share a list will be able to get feedback on said list from those who 
have access to it. While ListAssist is similar to other products such as Out of Milk or Any.do, these other 
products fail to capture the full utility of ListAssist. All list programs, including ListAssist and those 
mentioned above   have sharing and real time syncing capabilities for shared lists. These programs also
have the ability to add notes to different items and the ability to edit lists from a variety of platforms. 
ListAssist goes beyond the a normal list program and adds smart, personalized list options such as 
templates for different kinds of lists and suggestions to help you remember what you need to get done. 
In essence, ListAssist offers people a mobile solution to the problem “Now what did I need again?”
