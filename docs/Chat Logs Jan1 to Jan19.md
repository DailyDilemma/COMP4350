Hey guys, Brent, Mitch, Mark and I have come up with the ideas we like: an app to help developers, a game of some sort(maybe ccg/tcg), and grocery list app. If you two have any other ideas feel free to suggest.

Matt Deutscher
I like the grocery list app idea.

I added my project ideas, one is a grocery list app also and the other is a neat take on a weather app I've been meaning to try.
Also, I set up a repository for us, so when everyone gets a moment send me your github user ID and I'll add you to the repository.

Thirdly, I wanted to know people's opinion on what software we should use to coordinate ourselves. I'm a fan of Trello and would happily use it if everyone prefers that, but there is also a case to be made for just using GitHub issues as our To Do list since the instructor said they will be monitoring our GitHub repositories to determine how much work we've done.

Here is the ideas we came up with in the meeting today: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UgQvRl4LaQ31S8A6qLmx5Ozd7KnlHbh7OpMpasZ7pgc/edit?usp=sharing

As for communicating, I'll check out Trello (never heard of it before) and get back to you guys with an opinion.
Oh and my github id is MitchLenton.

Mitch Lenton
Trello seems pretty cool. I would be good with using that.

2016-01-14 16:32
Mark Cortilet
I'm ok with Trello. My Github id is Woods0

I took all the project ideas and put them in a survey, pick your favorite 3 and whichever gets the most votes wins

2016-01-15 19:03
Josh Westlake
I'm still missing 1 submission, but it doesn't matter... the grocery list app wins no matter what the last person picks. The tally...
5 for Grocery List
3 for Weather App
2 for Project Management
2 for Game
2 for Quiz App
1 for Chat Room
The responses I got indicate that Trello is the preferred way to organize ourselves, so I'll make a new board and break down the first milestone into cards people can pick up. If there is anything specific you want to do, go ahead and grab it or speak up.

2016-01-15 19:08
Josh Westlake
Lastly... no one officially got a chance to say if they wanted to act as a project lead on this... if you have more of an interest in coordinating the team I welcome you to do that. I don't prefer or enjoy the project management crap, but most people tell me they prefer if I do it so I've assumed the role for now. If you want it - it's yours :P

2016-01-15 19:21
Matt Deutscher
Sounds good.

2016-01-15 19:21
Mitch Lenton
Thanks for doing the poll Josh. The grocery list sounds like a good project. As for team lead, I'm open to anyone being the lead. Project management is not really my strong suit so I don't think I would be a good fit for the job, but I am more than willing to assist whoever is the lead.

I suggest that over the weekend everyone thinks up some features and adds them as cards to the "Big User Stories" list on the board. Once we have some big features we can use them to create the detailed user stories.
Don't be shy about over contributing to the Trello board, comment the hell out of it and if you don't like/understand the organization of it all feel free to propose another way to organize things :)

Mitch Lenton
Sounds good Josh and thanks for setting up the Trello board.

Okay, last thing for the night I swear... with respect to technology stacks my initial suggestion is we use a hybrid HTML5 framework that works on both the web and within a web container in a native android app, then we can make one web app and have it work in both places. I don't know if that's cheating, but I'll ask the prof. I've never used one myself, but here are several to look at it you're bored http://www.sitepoint.com/top-7-hybrid-mobile-app-frameworks/. If you have any other suggestions for frameworks / technologies feel free to say what you'd like to use or what you think we should use.

2016-01-16 10:30
Josh Westlake
Well, the prof says we can't use hybrid frameworks, he wants us to find a native framework for Android.

For some reason (I think because I accidentally removed him once), Messenger will not allow me to add Brent to our existing chat group, so I'm starting a new one to see if it allows Brent to join. If it does we'll all switch to this one.

2016-01-17 12:09
Brent Rempel
Hey I can see this!

2016-01-17 12:09
Josh Westlake
You named the group New COMP4350 Project Discussion.

Cool beans. I'm in as well.

2016-01-18 11:35
Josh Westlake
The main parts left to do are 1) Vision Statement 2) User Stories and 3) Framework Selection. I suggest we budget a little more time for tomorrow's meeting to talk about framework selection and I'll bring a bunch of index cards for us to crank out our initial user stories. (You're welcome to come up with user stories beforehand, but worst case we'll do them at the meeting). If we hash out everything in tomorrow's meeting that leaves us 24 hours to write everything up, which shouldn't be hard provided we agree on everything.

2016-01-18 11:38
Daniel J. Bouchard
Sounds good.

2016-01-18 11:38
Matt Deutscher
Ok
