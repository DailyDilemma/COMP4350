#Iteration 4 - Summary of Changes

This document is to assist the marker in identifying changes between this iteration and the last.

##What's New

* Our focus this iteration was bug fixing and adding as many new features as we could (which wasn't many, sorry)
  * Fixed the issue with checkboxes not saving in the web app (finally)
  * Implemented the suggestions feature in both the web app and on Android.
  * Merged in all of the refactored code for the WebAPI that was kept out last iteration due to lack of time to write tests for it.
  
##What Didn't Make It In

* We were only able to add one additional feature this iteration, so we are way short of the 9-12 we should have. Be gentle.
