#Iteration 3 - Summary of Changes

##What's New

* Our focus this iteration was addressing the feedback from last iteration and getting the Android app running.
* Based on feedback:
  * We updated the web front end to fetch data from our web api.
  * We installed Jasmine as per your suggestion to test our views, but we only have a couple of javascript methods to test. We have almost no custom javascript, the vast majority of our javascript is generated automatically by the .NET framework. 
* Based on assignment requirements
  * We added a new Android app which is available in a different repository (see the link on our front page)
  * We were not able to add any new features. Fixing the previous issues and adding an Android app was about all we could handle.
  * A basic level of unit tests and robotium tests are in the Android app.
 
##What Didn't Make It In

* Somehow, amazingly, we are 3 iterations into a todo list app and we still can't check an item off. 
* We did a lot of changes to the API at the last minute that WOULD have made many things work, but there wasn't enough time to modify our clients to accomodate all the fixes made to our WebAPI. We opted to freeze development while things were still reasonably stable and we'll integrate the fixes next iteration.
