# Vision Statement
The ListAssist product will help people organize and keep track of many different types of lists. Making multiple copies of a list and trying to synchronize it between multiple people is tedious and error prone - ListAssist will allow people to easily share any list with anyone else, across multiple devices.

ListAssist is designed for everyone who uses lists to keep track of the many things they need to get done, but also needs to share their lists with others. It will permit anyone using it to easily set up a list, share that list with others, and have others that are sharing the list add items and check items off as they are completed. This way, there is no need to worry if someone else has already completed a task on the list, everyone that has access to the list will see what has been completed instantly.

The application will make creating a personalized list quick and easy, through the use of common templates as well as suggestions for common items added to that type of list. For example, if a person wanted to create a grocery list for their household, ListAssist would suggest a number of commonly purchased items to add to the list, based on past lists and the frequency that those items get purchased. You will never forget the milk again.

ListAssist is envisioned as both a web-based application, and a mobile Android application for those on the go.

While ListAssist is similar to other products such as Out of Milk or Any.do, these other products fail to capture the full utility of ListAssist. All list programs, including ListAssist, and those mentioned above, have sharing and real time syncing capabilities for shared lists. Many of these programs also have the ability to add notes to different items, and the ability to edit lists from a variety of platforms. ListAssist goes beyond the normal list program and adds smart, personalized list options, such as templates for different kinds of lists and suggestions to help you remember what you need to get done. In essence, ListAssist offers people a mobile solution to the problem “Now, what did I need again?”

This project will be considered a success, if after 1 year on the market, the application has in excess of 250,000 users, both mobile and web-based, with a median user satisfaction rating of not less than 3.8 on Google Play.
